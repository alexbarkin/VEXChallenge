### Challenge 3
Challenge 3 was to pick up 3 tennis balls in a line and place them within a tennis ball tube, go around to pick up 3 more tennis balls and place them in another tube as well. The two lines of 3 tennis balls were parallel to each other. The challenge was to be completed within 3 minutes, and was timed to be completed in 2 minutes and 31 seconds.
